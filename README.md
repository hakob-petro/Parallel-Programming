# Parallel-Programming
Solutions of some parallel-programming tasks using pthreads and MPI technologies.  
List of tasks:
- HelloMPI - hello world with MPI on systems with distributed memory  
- NumberSend - forward the number through all nodes of system with distributed memory every time increasing it 
- Integral - make parallel integration on system with shared memory using pthreads  
- DiffScheme - compute the solution of termal equation(difference scheme) on system with distributed memory using MPI
